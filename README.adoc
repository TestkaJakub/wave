= wave: Linear Chirp Generator

wave is a Rust-based Windows application that generates a linear chirp signal, which smoothly sweeps between two frequencies over a specified duration, and saves the resulting audio to a .wav file. The application offers a flexible CLI and runtime experience for defining parameters.

== Features

Generate linear chirp signals between a start frequency and an end frequency.

Specify the duration of the chirp.

Save the generated audio to a .wav file.

Provide parameters via CLI arguments or interactively at runtime.

== Installation

Using Prebuilt Releases

Download the latest release from the GitHub Releases page: wave Releases

Run the executable.

Building from Source

If you prefer to build the application from source, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. If not, download it from https://rustup.rs/. Then:

Clone the repository:

[source,]
----
git clone https://github.com/TestkaJakub/wave.git
cd wave
----

Build the application:

[source,]
----
cargo build --release
----

The executable can be found in the target/release/ directory.

== Usage

The application can be run with or without providing CLI arguments. Missing arguments will be requested interactively at runtime.

=== CLI Arguments

wave [OPTIONS]

==== Options

-i, --initial_freq <FREQ>
: The starting frequency of the chirp in Hz (e.g., 440).

-e, --ending_freq <FREQ>
: The ending frequency of the chirp in Hz (e.g., 880).

-d, --duration <SECONDS>
: The duration of the chirp in seconds (e.g., 5).

-o, --output_name <FILE>
: The name of the output .wav file (e.g., chirp.wav).

-h, --help
: Display help information.

=== Examples

Generate a chirp from 440 Hz to 880 Hz over 5 seconds and save it as chirp.wav:

wave -i 440 -e 880 -d 5 -o chirp.wav

Run the application interactively, skipping CLI arguments:

wave

The application will prompt for:

Initial frequency (Hz)

Ending frequency (Hz)

Duration (seconds)

Output file name (.wav)

== Development

To run the application in development mode:

cargo run

You can also pass arguments directly:

cargo run -- -i 440 -e 880 -d 5 -o chirp.wav
